Which version of express are you using? – \r\nzemirco\r\n Sep 21, 2012 at 17:31 \r\nI'm having the same issue. req.route is undefined. Im using express 3.4.4. What can cause route to be undefined? – \r\ndavidpfahler\r\n Nov 12, 2013 at 20:50\r\n@vinayr req.route.path still gives me /create instead of /quizzes/create, which is the whole URL – \r\nSandip Subedi\r\n Apr 15, 2017 at 20:02\r\nThis is intended behavior. And you should embrace it. Your handler should not care about the full path, but only about the 'local' part of the path. That's the part after the path it was mounted on. This makes the handler function more easy to reuse in other contexts. – \r\nStijn de Witt\r\n Dec 9, 2017 at 18:28","id":1686026839855,"author":"Sahil Mistry"}]}
